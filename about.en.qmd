## What’s This Blog About?

This blog is a space where I’ll be focusing on content related to programming in R, mostly around topics connected to Human Resources and People Analytics. *(2025 update: I’ll also be adding Python content.)*

Honestly, at this point, I’m not interested in making something overly formal just to *"look professional."* What I really want is to create content that’s useful for anyone starting their career in People Analytics and for those who are constantly learning.

All content in this blog is open and free to share, as long as the source is properly credited.

Here, you’ll find content related to R, as well as more general and "conceptual" topics about People Analytics.

If you’d like to get in touch or learn more about me, you can do so through my social media or via the networks of [R4HR - Club de R para RRHH](https://linktr.ee/r4hrclub).
